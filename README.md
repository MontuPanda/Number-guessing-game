Number guessing game


There is mainly 2 differences between version 1 and 2.
Version 1 has 3 set difficulties. Easy medium and hard. it is also buggy, that when entering a difficuty it says its invalid and when you reenter it works.
Version 2 as far as I know does not have bugs, and the user inputs the starting range, so has a wide range of difficulties.


and the version titled tries gives you a set number of tries based on the difficulty
